# Resume - Portfolio 

This is a small project I did to have a simple skeleton of an application that can be used as a resume/portfolio when presenting yourself to the rest of the world.

I focused on having something simple with a clean UI that is easy to read and performance enough to be rendered in any device.

Please, feel free to fork it and create your own!

## Tech Stack

#### Taildwind CSS
Low-level CSS [framework](https://tailwindcss.com/) that provides utility classes that let you build custom designs without ever leaving your HTML, and keeping your custom CSS files pretty small.

### Netlify
I personally used Netlify to deploy and host the website, and I recommend this because of its simplicity. Find more info [here](https://www.netlify.com/).

I created the design of the website inspired by the following two projects:
https://github.com/wahyuway/nuxtjs-resume-template
https://startbootstrap.com/themes/resume/

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
