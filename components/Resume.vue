            I have worked as a Developer since 2011, I started as a
            consultant/back end developer, and due to the fact that I always
            liked UI/UX related topics, I did a switch to front end in 2013 when
            I started my first assigment. And since then, I have been exploring
            different technologies, and I still enjoy the challenges it brings.

                different Javascript frameworks/libraries such as React, Svelte,

            Besides work, I usually spend my free time outdoors playing sports

            When I am not running outside, I am behind my drums, instrument that
            I play since I was a little kid, and I still enjoy playing the good
            old punk rock songs that I used to listen to when I was at high
            school.
